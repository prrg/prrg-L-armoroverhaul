# Prrg's Light Armor Overhaul (ALPHA)
This is an armor overhaul inspired by the one made by lekousin. It is much lighter, being less about new things and more about tweaking existing things.

# Features
 - 3 new configurations to existing armors.

# Thanks to...
 - lekousin - for most of the original coding (mostly modified).
 - UnknownCheats - for their amazing repository of tutorials and coding.
 - reddit users - for giving me ideas on how to improve the mod.
 - My friend 'gcantudo' - for being a dick.
