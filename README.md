# Prrg's Light Armor Overhaul (ALPHA)
This is an armor overhaul inspired by the one made by lekousin. It is much lighter, being less about new things and more about tweaking existing things.

# Features
 - 5 new configurations to existing armors.

# Thanks to...
 - lekousin - for most of the original coding (mostly modified).
 - UnknownCheats - for their amazing repository of tutorials and coding.
 - reddit users - for giving me ideas on how to improve the mod.
 - My friend 'gcantudo' - for being a dick.
 - Melting Terminal - for the 'Custom Script' mod.

# A warning!
Now everyone agrees with pLAO. Some may flag you as cheater, even when the game iself doesn't. Have this in mind when downloading the mod. It has some very, very noticeable features, like starting without any armor (or for some others, very low stamina or very high stamina as well).

For good safety, most would want to use it only on offline or with friends.

# Be careful!
This is a pre-alpha branch, it's use is not always safe and/or recommended. And you will be subject of several updates.

# How to install.
 - If you don't have it, download BLT or BLT:CSE (better lua injector) from paydaymods.com
 - Download the pre-alpha or master branch.
 - Ignore the 'README.md' file and move the main folder to the 'mods' folder in your PAYDAY2 directory.
